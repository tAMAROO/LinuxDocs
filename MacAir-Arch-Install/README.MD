This is how I install Arch + qtile on MacBook Air 7,2.  This is to make install faster and customized to my needs.  Most information is pulled from the listed sources with a couple of tweaks along the way.

### ###Note###
This was only tested on my MacBook Air 7,2 and is only meant for this system.  For other applications use the official Arch install guide [Arch Installation Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide)

Please understand this is not all my work and credit goes to the two individuals listed in the sources. I am just putting how I was able to use the two sources together and tweak the setup to better understand the process and easily build a stable Arch install quickly.

I will continue to add to this repo and add links and information where needed.  Will add fixes and where the information was found for issues that arise.
